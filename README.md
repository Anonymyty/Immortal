# Immortal
Prevent expiration of signed iOS applications &amp; bypass 3 free signed applications per device limit

## Benefits
After installing Immortal, you can use [Cydia Impactor](http://cydiaimpactor.com/) to install unlimited number of applications and games that are signed just using a free Apple ID. They will live on your iDevice forever and will never get expired or revoked.

## What problem does Immortal solve
Free Apple IDs have two limitations for side-loading:

1. You can have 3 side-loaded application on one device simultaneously.
2. You can side-load maximum number of 10 applications each week.

Immortal tweak removes first limit, because it's something which is checked on device. You just need to lock & unlock your device after installing each 3 applications, and then continue installing 3 others; until you reach 10 applications per 7 days limit.

Second limit is set on Apple's server and can't get bypassed using any tweak.

## How to use
- You can resign 10 new applications each week with the same account used before. Nothing gets expired or revoked, but you still have limit of 10 application per week.
- You can use multiple accounts, and resign 10 applications in week using each one. So you can resign as many as applications and games you want, by changing account when you reach 10 resigns per week.

[Cydia Impactor](http://cydiaimpactor.com/) is the main application which is used for resigning with free Apple IDs.

## Installation
Immortal is on both [BigBoss](http://thebigboss.org) and [personal repo](http://ahmadhashemi.com/cydia). Being on BigBoss means you just need to open Cydia and type Immortal in search section to find tweak and install it.

## Note
Don't forget that Immortal is a tweak, and only works when your device is in jailbroken state. **This means even after installing Immortal, you should manage signing of main Yalu application like before, to be able to put your device in jailbroken mode.** But after jailbreaking using Yalu and going into jailbroken state, Immortal takes care of everything and opens every signed application for you, whether they are expired or revoked.
