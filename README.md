# Immortal
Prevent expiration of signed iOS applications &amp; bypass 3 free signed applications per device limit

## Benefits
After installing Immortal, you can use [Cydia Impactor](http://cydiaimpactor.com/) to install unlimited number of applications and games that are signed just using a free Apple ID. They will live on your iDevice forever and will never get expired or revoked.

## Installation
Immortal is on both [BigBoss](http://thebigboss.org) and [personal repo](http://ahmadhashemi.com/cydia). Being on BigBoss means you just need to open Cydia and type Immortal in search section to find tweak and install it.

## Note
Don't forget that Immortal is a tweak, and only works when your device is in jailbroken state. **This means even after installing Immortal, you should manage signing of main Yalu application like before, to be able to put your device in jailbroken mode.** But after jailbreaking using Yalu and going into jailbroken state, Immortal takes care of everything and opens every signed application for you, whether they are broken or revoked.
